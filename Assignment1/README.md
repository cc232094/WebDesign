# Incorporated Feedback

I chose to change the background for the title header to sea green, a different color from the CSS color selection website, from coral after I was suggested by a peer to do so. I also changed the text color within the title header to be white so it would stand out from the new color. For all text elements, I increased the text size in pixels to make each piece of text substantially larger than before.

I decided to utilize the peer feedback of changing the title header's background color as they made a compelling argument, though I did deviate slightly from their feedback. They specifically mentioned that I could change this to "sage green", but the color was not listed on the CSS color selection website and I was unsure if we still had to follow that website for color usage, but the deviation is minor. I did follow through with this change because my peer had noted that green, alongside the present beige, would fit more in line with the military aspect of my selected book. It also helps to break up the title as now there are not two warm colors placed together. I also increased the size of all pieces of text in order to fit in line with my own feedback I gave to some others. The differences in text size between each header is much more substantial, making it easier to distinguish headings, and all text became much easier to read when they started to take up more of the page.
