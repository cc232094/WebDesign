    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>We are introduced to John Clark, a counterterrorism operative whose years of experience has led him to being selected as the leader of a new international counterterrorism unit. This unit is known as Rainbow, created as a result of the rise of global terrorism and designed to quickly respond to any terrorist attacks around the world. The unit is also to be made up of professional operatives from various different nations, introducing the story's theme of strong cooperation and trust being needed to combat terrorism.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
    <p>The focus is now shifted onto the actual formation of Rainbow. John Clark travels and meets with intelligence officials to discuss the creation of a team, then delving into the recruitment process. Clark and the officials observe and evaluate soldiers of various countries, with Clark in particular not only judging for basic performance, but for stress management and responses to commands. During this process, the base for Rainbow is established in the United Kingdom as the unit slowly develops into something substantial.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
    <p>After individual training, the early members of Rainbow begin training together so their teamwork skills can be evaluated. Clark observes and notes strengths and weaknesses of members of the group as they go through various counterterrorism simulations. We are also introduced to Domingo Chavez, otherwise known as "Ding", whose strong performance distinguishes him among the other recruits and shows his significance as a member of the unit.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <p>A major terrorist strike is carried out in Europe. We follow these terrorists in this chapter as they begin targeting civilians and taking hostages to draw as much attention to their cause while also establishing themselves as a serious threat. Their coordination and mistakes are highlighted to detail just who Rainbow are going up against, with intelligence agencies finding this group too dangerous for local officials to deal with alone. This sets the stage for Rainbow to deploy on their first real mission. </p>
